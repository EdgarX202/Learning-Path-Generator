*/ MOODLE AI - An AI-Powered Learning Path Generator /*

Technologies used:
	- Backend: Flask, Python, MySQL
	- Frontend: React, Vite, Bootstrap
	- AI/LLM: Ollama (Llama3)
	- Database: MySQL
	- PDF Processing: PyMuPDF

Prerequisites.
Before running the project, you need to have the following installed on your system:
	- Python 3.8+
	- Node.js & npm (or yarn)
	- MySQL Server
	- Ollama: The application must be installed and running. You also need to have the Llama3 model pulled by running "ollama pull llama3" in your terminal.

Setup.
Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:
	1. Database
		- Start your MySQL server.
		- Create a new database named "university_db".
		- Execute the SQL script from "university_db.sql" to create the necessary tables and populate them with initial data.
	
	2. Backend (Flask)
		- Navigate to the backend folder directory in your terminal.
		- Create a Python virtual environment: "python -m venv .venv".
		- Activate the virtual environment: ".venv\Scripts\activate".
		- Install the required Python packages from requirements.txt: "pip install -r requirements.txt".
		- Create a ".env" file in the backend directory and add your database and Ollama configuration:
			+ Your app.py is configured to connect to a local Ollama instance and uses root for the database user with no password.
			+ If your MySQL setup is different, you will need to modify the "db_config" dictionary in app.py or use environmental variables.

	3. Frontend (React)
		- Navigate to the frontend directory in a new terminal window.
		- Install the Node.js dependencies: "npm install".

	4. Run the application
	   You will need to run both the backend and frontend concurrently.
		- Start the Flask Backend.
			+ Make sure your virtual environment is active in the backend directory.
			+ Run the Flask development server: "flask run --port=5001" or "python app.py"
			+ The API will be available at http://localhost:5001.
		
		- Start the React Frontend.
			+ Make sure you are in the frontend directory.
			+ Run the Vite development server: "npm run dev".
			+ The application will be available in your browser at http://localhost:5173 (or a similar port)
