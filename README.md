# Masters-Project
Project: Creating a Learning Path Generator (LPG) and integrating it into the mock university website.<br>
<br>
 <strong>Main Tasks</strong>:<br>
 - Build a website similar to Napier university website.
 - Create a database for storing courses, modules, students, staff and other.
 - Create an AI agent that is capable of analysing the module content and generate a learning path for a student.
 - Integrate it into the website.
<br>
<strong>Research Question:</strong>
 - How can personalised learning paths affect undergraduate student engagement and learning effetiveness in tech courses(e.g. software development)?<br>
 <br>
   1. How can the benefits differ between theoretical and practical courses within universities technology curriculum?<br>
   2. To what extent can personalised learning path system accurately reccomend learning resources and predict student mastery in specific topics, based on course content?
<br>
<br>
<strong>The Website: </strong>
Built using Python/Flask + React/JavaScript
<br>
<br>
<strong>The AI agent:</strong>
Local Ollama (Llama3) model. Offline (local) for development purposes. Use ChatGPT/Gemini/Deepseek API keys for online access if in production.
